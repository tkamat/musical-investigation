<li class="fragment roll-in"><p>
Ravi Shankar was an extremely influential sitarist from Bengal, India. He
had a distinct playing style characterized by unconventional rhythmic cycles
and flowing, but disjunct, melodic lines.

<li class="fragment roll-in">Miles Davis was a jazz trumpeter and musician that was well know for
developing the modal jazz and jazz fusion genres. His album <i>Kind of Blue</i>
is often considered the best jazz record of all time.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">While both of these musicians developed independently and focused on
completely different genres, their music actually shares many common links
and similarities.</li>

<h2 id="org40890f7">Characteristics of Hindustani Music</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Hindustani music is built on the raga, which literally translates to
"color." Ragas are scales and melodies that form the basis for the
performance, and their purpose is to form the mood or emotional basis for
the music, rather than just providing structure as scales do in western
music.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Hindustani music is generally monodic, and the melody is generally
accompanied by various instruments, such as the tabla, which is used to
create complex polyrhythms.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">The meter of Hindustani music varies greatly between compositions, with
meters ranging from simple duple or triple meters to 7 or 14 beat mixed
meters.</li>

<h2 id="orgc560bfc">Raag Khamaj</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in"><p>
The Khamaj is one of the ten Thaats (parent scales) of Hindustani classical
music. The improvisational scale for this raga is shown below:

</div>

</div></li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in">The scales are different when ascending and descending, and they have a
different number of notes, with the ascending scale having 6 notes (called
shadav) and the descending scale having 7 notes (called sampoorna).</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Raag Khamaj uses Teentaal, which is a fast 16 beat rhythm.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="orgc68adb6">Miles Davis, Modal Jazz, and <i>Kind of Blue</i></h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Miles Davis was one of the pioneers of the modal jazz movement, and along
with his colleagues John Coltrane, Bill Evans, and Cannonball Adderley, he
redefined what jazz music sounded like.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">In <i>Kind of Blue</i>, Davis and his extremely talented band rejected
traditional chord progressions in favor of modal scales, and they put a
heavy emphasis on improvisation and spontaneity.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Modal jazz, like most other forms of jazz, originated with the blues, and a
lot of traditional blues elements can be found in modal jazz, such as the
strophic "Head/Solo/Head" structure. In this structure, the music begins
with a "head" that serves as the main chorus, followed by a usually lengthy
improvisation section, and finally a return to the head.</li>

</ul>
</section>

<section>
<section id="slide-orgada3c03" data-background="SteelBlue">
<h2 id="orgada3c03"><i>So What</i></h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in"><i>So What</i> is known for having the melody in the bass line, which was very
unusual then and still unusual today.</li>

</ul>

<div class="fragment roll-in leftcol_40">

</div>

</div>

<div class="fragment roll-in rightcol_60">
<ul>
<li>The head is followed by improvisation by each melodic instrument, including
the alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, trumpet, piano, and bass.</li>

</ul>

</div>

<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in">The piece is quite simple harmonically, and the piece uses an AABA
structure. The only harmonic shift is the switch from the D dorian mode to
the E flat dorian mode in the B section.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">The simplicity of <i>So What</i> and other modal jazz pieces was intentional, as Miles
Davis wanted to give musicians freedom to improvise without being
constrained by a strict chord progression.</li>

<section id="slide-org3f5888e">
<h2 id="org3f5888e">Musical Links</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Despite the great difference in cultures and location between these two
musical styles, they share many similarities.
<ol>
<li>Both pieces diverge from traditional western chord progressions in the
harmonies and tonality, with <i>Raag Khamaj</i> using the raga and <i>So What</i>
using modes.</li>
<li>Both pieces have a similar structure, with an opening melody followed by
improvisation.</li>
<li>Both pieces share similar tonal and melodic constructs, such as quickly
ascending or descending arpeggios and phrases, use of the chromatic
scale, and bent notes.</li>

</ol></li>

<h2 id="org5c42cf8">Harmony and Tonality in <i>So What</i></h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in"><i>So What</i>, as mentioned before, has a very uniform harmonic structure, and
the only modulation is the half-step movement from D dorian to E flat dorian
in the B section.
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in">The first solo by Davis (see below) centers around the D minor pentatonic.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Davis leaves lots of open spaces in his solo, which are filled by open
voicings centering around diatonic 4th chords, played by the pianist Bill
Evans.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">As the solo progresses, Davis transitions from the minor pentatonic to a
more linear style focusing on the dorian scale. He often returns back to
the base note D.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">In the his second transition to the B section, Davis enters early with a
high, extended, dissonant A flat. Overall however, Davis tends to stay in
the dorian mode or pentatonic scale, but he occasionally breaks from the
scale, such as with the "blues note".</li>

<section id="slide-org7e961ea" data-background="Coral">
<h2 id="org7e961ea">Harmony and Tonality in <i>Raag Khamaj</i></h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Shankar's performance of <i>Raag Khamaj</i> similarly revolves around a single
scale, which is in this case the <i>Khamaj</i> raga.
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Just like Davis, many of Ravi Shankar's riffs travel up and down the raga,
but repeatedly end on the same note, which is in this case F natural (the
second note in the ascending scale).</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">This repeated note is known as the vadi in Hindustani music, and it
serves as the dominant note of the piece.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Also similar to <i>So What</i>, <i>Raag Khamaj</i> has a flat note in the descending
scale known as the komal, which serves the same function as the blues note
in <i>So What</i>. This note is used to add color and mood to the music, and it
is often played repeatedly to add tension.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Similar to how <i>So What</i> only uses 2 chords to encourage more free-form
improvisation, this composition maintains the same raga throughout. While
Shankar does switch between the ascending and descending scales, the base
raga itself never changes.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">The static nature of the tonality forces the improviser to use the scale
itself to create music and melody, rather than just following the chord
changes.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-orgbbecc0b" data-background="Coral">
<h2 id="orgbbecc0b">Structure in <i>Raag Khamaj</i></h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Raag Khamaj consists of a short, repeated melody of only 5 pitches that is
returned to throughout the piece. This is known as the bandish.</li>

</ul>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/bandish.png" alt="bandish.png" class="fragment roll-in" width="50%" />
</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in">The bandish is followed by improvisation by Ravi Shankar and Anoushka
Shankar, who generally play seperatly but occasionally play
together in polyphony or exchange lines in call and response.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">The improvisers generally return to the bandish after their improvisation,
usually following a crescendo.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">There is an accelerando at the end of the piece, which is followed by a
cathartic conclusion consisting of repeating sequences of ascending notes and
ending on tonic (C sharp).</li>

</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org208e32d" data-background="SteelBlue">
<h2 id="org208e32d">Structure in <i>So What</i></h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in"><i>So What</i>'s structure is very similar to <i>Raag Khamaj</i>, as it consists of a
simple melody called the "head," followed by extended improvisation. The
chord structure is AABA.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Also similiar to <i>Raag Khamaj</i>, multiple improvisers take turns soloing.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">While the main instruments never play together, some polyphony is achieved
through the interaction between the improviser, piano, and dynamic bass
line.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in"><i>So What</i> also features a return to the head after the improvisation
section, which ends in a decrescendo with all of the instruments eventually
dropping out.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Another similarity with Hindustani music is the call and response structure
used in the head, with the piano and the horns "answering" the melody played
by the bass. This format was originally influenced by traditional African
American slave music, and remarkably, it is also similiar to the call and
response exchange between the 2 sitar players in <i>Raag Khamaj</i>.</li>

<section id="slide-org1b52912" data-background="SteelBlue">
<h2 id="org1b52912">Melody and Tone in <i>So What</i></h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in"><p>
The improvisers in <i>So What</i>, especially Davis and Coltrane, have very
similiar styles to Hindustani music.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Coltrane especially uses many of the same techniques, such as using
rhythmic sequences in his licks, beginning with slower phrases, then
transitioning to very quick phrases ascending and descending the chromatic
scale, as seen below.</li>

</ul>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/chromatic.png" alt="chromatic.png" class="fragment roll-in" width="75%" />
</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Additionally, both Davis and Coltrane have very high ranges, with Davis
traversing it using piercing, disjunct notes, and Coltrane using flowing
runs.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">All of the improvisers also hit many melodic peaks throughout their solos,
especially "Cannonball" Adderley, who often ends his sequences with two or three
eighth notes of the same pitch played in swing.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Coltrane and Adderley frequently use rapid trills and other
fast and technical ornamentation in their melodies.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Finally, both saxophonists also make use of techniques such as vibrato,
"growling," and bending notes, which is meant to emulate the human voice
in traditional African American singing.</li>

</ul></li>

<section id="slide-org78e5ea3" data-background="Coral">
<h2 id="org78e5ea3">Melody and Tone in <i>Raag Khamaj</i></h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in"><p>
Surprisingly, <i>Raag Khamaj</i> and Hindustani music in general shares many of
the same melodic constructs as Jazz.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Just like Coltrane in <i>So What</i>, Ravi Shankar frequently ascends up and
then down the chromatic scale. However, his playing also shares
similarities to Davis, in that he sometimes moves up or down the raga
disjunctly using arpeggios, seen below.</li>

</ul>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/arpeg.png" alt="arpeg.png" class="fragment roll-in" width="50%" />
</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Many of the melodic peaks in <i>Raag Khamaj</i> are formed by repeating a
single note over and over again in a crescendo, which usually ends with a
transition back to the bandish.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Ravi Shankar also frequently uses bent notes in his music,</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Finally, just like in Jazz music, Ravi Shankar frequently uses syncopation in
his melodies, which is again demonstrated above.</li>

</ul></li>

<section id="slide-orgff4f450">
<h2 id="orgff4f450">Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in">In conclusion, Hindustani Classical Music and Modal Jazz share many
similarities that are quite surprising considering that the two cultures are
completely separate geographically.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">This investigation helped me connect the music of my Indian heritage to the
jazz music that I love to listen to and play on the saxophone and piano.</li>
