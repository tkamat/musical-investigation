Ravi Shankar was an extremely influential sitarist from Bengal, India. He
had a distinct playing style characterized by unconventional rhythmic cycles
and flowing, but disjunct, melodic lines.

<li class="fragment roll-in">Miles Davis was a jazz trumpeter and musician that was well know for
developing the modal jazz and jazz fusion genres. His album <i>Kind of Blue</i>
is often considered the best jazz record of all time.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">While both of these musicians developed independently and focused on
completely different genres, their music actually shares many common links
and similarities.</li>

<h2 id="org224c085">Characteristics of Hindustani Music</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Hindustani music is built on the raga, which literally translates to
"color." Ragas are scales and melodies that form the basis for the
performance, and their purpose is to form the mood or emotional basis for
the music, rather than providing structure as scales do in western music.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Hindustani music is generally monodic, and the melody is generally
accompanied by various instruments, such as the tabla, which is used to
create complex polyrhythms.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">The meter of Hindustani music varies greatly between compositions, with
meters ranging from simple duple or triple meters to 7 or 14 beat mixed
meters.</li>

<h2 id="org07c1f1c">Raag Khamaj</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in"><p>
The Khamaj is one of the ten Thaats (parent scales) of Hindustani classical
music. The improvisational scale for this raga is shown below:
</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/khamaj_scale.png" alt="khamaj_scale.png" width="50%" />
</p>
</div></li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">As seen above, the scale contains 9 notes, which means it does not conform
to western scales, which generally contain 8 notes. However, the scale is
quite close to the western Mixolydian mode, which matches Raga Khamaj exactly except
for an extra B natural in the raga.</li>

<h2 id="orgc990eeb">Miles Davis, Modal Jazz, and <i>Kind of Blue</i></h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Miles Davis was one of the pioneers of the modal jazz movement, and along
with his colleagues John Coltrane, Bill Evans, and Cannonball Adderley, he
redefined what jazz music sounded like.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">In <i>Kind of Blue</i>, Davis and his extremely talented band rejected
traditional chord progressions in favor of modal scales, and they put a
heavy emphasis on improvisation and spontaneity.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Modal jazz, like most other forms of jazz, originated with the blues, and a
lot of traditional blues elements can be found in modal jazz, such as the
strophic "Head/Solo/Head" structure. In this structure, the music begins
with a "head" that serves as the main chorus, followed by a usually lengthy
improvisation section, and finally a return to the head.</li>

<h2 id="org8091199"><i>So What</i></h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in"><i>So What</i> is known for having the melody in the bass line, which was very
unusual then and still unusual today.</li>

<div class="fragment roll-in rightcol_60">
<ul>
<li>The head is followed by improvisation by each melodic instrument, including
the alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, trumpet, piano, and bass.</li>

</ul>

</div>

<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in">The piece is quite simple harmonically, and the piece uses an AABA
structure. The only harmonic shift is the switch from the D dorian mode to
the E flat dorian mode in the B section.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">The simplicity of <i>So What</i> and other modal jazz pieces was intentional, as Miles
Davis wanted to give musicians freedom to improvise without being
constrained by a strict chord progression.</li>

<h2 id="org85df211">Musical Links</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Despite the great difference in cultures and location between these two
musical styles, they share many similarities.
<ol>
<li>Both pieces diverge from traditional western chord progressions in the
harmonies and tonality, with <i>Raag Khamaj</i> using the raga and <i>So What</i>
using modes.</li>
<li>Both pieces have a similar structure, with an opening melody followed by
improvisation.</li>
<li>Both pieces share similar melodic constructs, such as quickly ascending
or descending arpeggios and phrases, use of the chromatic scale, and
bent notes in phrases.</li>

<h2 id="org456b60d">Harmony and Tonality</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in"><i>So What</i>, as mentioned before, has a very uniform harmonic structure, and
the only modulation is the half-step movement from D dorian to E flat dorian
in the B section.
<ul>
<li>The first solo by Davis (see below) centers around the D minor pentatonic.</li>
<li>Davis leaves lots of open spaces in his solo, which are filled by open
voicings centering around 4th chords, played by the pianist Bill Evans.</li>
<li>As the solo progresses, Davis transitions from the minor pentatonic to a
more linear style focusing on the dorian scale.</li>
<li>In the his second transition to the B section, Davis enters early with a
high, extended, dissonant A flat. Overall however, Davis tends to stay in
the dorian mode or pentatonic scale, but he occasionaly breaks from the
scale, such as with the "blues note".</li>
