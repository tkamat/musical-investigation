  - Ravi Shankar was an extremely influential sitarist from Bengal, India. He
    had a distinct playing style characterized by unconventional rhythmic cycles
    and flowing, but disjunct, melodic lines.

  - Miles Davis was a jazz trumpeter and musician that was well know for
    developing the modal jazz and jazz fusion genres. His album /Kind of Blue/
    is often considered the best jazz record of all time.
  - While both of these musicians developed independently and focused on
    completely different genres, their music actually shares many common links
    and similarities.
* Musical Pieces
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - My first piece is Ravi Shankar's live performance of /Raag Khamaj/, which he
    performed with his daughter.

  - My second piece is the Miles Davis quintet performance of /All Blues/, from
    his album /Kind of Blue/.

* Characteristics of Hindustani Music

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - Hindustani music is built on the raga, which literally translates to
    "color." Ragas are scales and melodies that form the basis for the
    performance, and their purpose is to form the mood or emotional basis for
    the music, rather than providing structure as scales do in western music.
  - Hindustani music is generally monodic, and the melody is generally
    accompanied by various instruments, such as the tabla, which is used to
    create complex polyrhythms.
  - The meter of Hindustani music varies greatly between compositions, with
    meters ranging from simple duple or triple meters to 7 or 14 beat mixed
    meters.

* Raag Khamaj

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - The Khamaj is one of the ten Thaats (parent scales) of Hindustani classical
    music. The improvisational scale for this raga is shown below:
    #+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
    [[./images/khamaj_scale.png]]
  - As seen above, the scale contains 9 notes, which means it does not conform
    to western scales, which generally contain 8 notes. However, the scale is
    quite close to the western Mixolydian mode, which matches Raga Khamaj exactly except
    for an extra B natural in the raga.
* Miles Davis, Modal Jazz, and /Kind of Blue/
  :PROPERTIES:
  :reveal_background: SteelBlue

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Miles Davis was one of the pioneers of the modal jazz movement, and along
    with his colleagues John Coltrane, Bill Evans, and Cannonball Adderley, he
    redefined what jazz music sounded like.
  - In /Kind of Blue/, Davis and his extremely talented band rejected
    traditional chord progressions in favor of modal scales, and they put a
    heavy emphasis on improvisation and spontaneity.
  - Modal jazz, like most other forms of jazz, originated with the blues, and a
    lot of traditional blues elements can be found in modal jazz, such as the
    strophic "Head/Solo/Head" structure. In this structure, the music begins
    with a "head" that serves as the main chorus, followed by a usually lengthy
    improvisation section, and finally a return to the head.
* /So What/
  :PROPERTIES:
  :reveal_background: SteelBlue
  :END:

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - /So What/ is known for having the melody in the bass line, which was very
    unusual then and still unusual today.

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
  #+BEGIN_rightcol_60
  - The head is followed by improvisation by each melodic instrument, including
    the alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, trumpet, piano, and bass.
  #+END_rightcol_60

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - The piece is quite simple harmonically, and the piece uses an AABA
    structure. The only harmonic shift is the switch from the D dorian mode to
    the E flat dorian mode in the B section.
  - The simplicity of /So What/ and other modal jazz pieces was intentional, as Miles
    Davis wanted to give musicians freedom to improvise without being
    constrained by a strict chord progression.
* Musical Links
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - Despite the great difference in cultures and location between these two
    musical styles, they share many similarities.
    1. Both pieces diverge from traditional western chord progressions in the
       harmonies and tonality, with /Raag Khamaj/ using the raga and /So What/
       using modes.
    2. Both pieces have a similar structure, with an opening melody followed by
       improvisation.
    3. Both pieces share similar melodic constructs, such as quickly ascending
       or descending arpeggios and phrases, use of the chromatic scale, and
       bent notes in phrases.

* Harmony and Tonality
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - /So What/, as mentioned before, has a very uniform harmonic structure, and
    the only modulation is the half-step movement from D dorian to E flat dorian
    in the B section.
    - The first solo by Davis (see below) centers around the D minor pentatonic.
    - Davis leaves lots of open spaces in his solo, which are filled by open
      voicings centering around 4th chords, played by the pianist Bill Evans.
    - As the solo progresses, Davis transitions from the minor pentatonic to a
      more linear style focusing on the dorian scale.
    - In the his second transition to the B section, Davis enters early with a
      high, extended, dissonant A flat. Overall however, Davis tends to stay in
      the dorian mode or pentatonic scale, but he occasionaly breaks from the
      scale, such as with the "blues note".

* Harmony and Tonality (Continued) 
  - Shankar's performance of /Raag Khamaj/ similarly revolves around a single
    scale, which is in this case the /Khamaj/.
