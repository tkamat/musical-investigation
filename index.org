  - Ravi Shankar was an extremely influential sitarist from Bengal, India. He
    had a distinct playing style characterized by unconventional rhythmic cycles
    and flowing, but disjunct, melodic lines.

  - Miles Davis was a jazz trumpeter and musician that was well know for
    developing the modal jazz and jazz fusion genres. His album /Kind of Blue/
    is often considered the best jazz record of all time.
  - While both of these musicians developed independently and focused on
    completely different genres, their music actually shares many common links
    and similarities.
* Musical Pieces
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - My first piece is Ravi Shankar's live performance of /Raag Khamaj/, which he
    performed with his daughter Anoushka.

  - My second piece is the Miles Davis quintet performance of /So What/, from
    his album /Kind of Blue/.

* Characteristics of Hindustani Music
  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - Hindustani music is built on the raga, which literally translates to
    "color." Ragas are scales and melodies that form the basis for the
    performance, and their purpose is to form the mood or emotional basis for
    the music, rather than just providing structure as scales do in western
    music.
  - Hindustani music is generally monodic, and the melody is generally
    accompanied by various instruments, such as the tabla, which is used to
    create complex polyrhythms.
  - The meter of Hindustani music varies greatly between compositions, with
    meters ranging from simple duple or triple meters to 7 or 14 beat mixed
    meters.

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - The Khamaj is one of the ten Thaats (parent scales) of Hindustani classical
    music. The improvisational scale for this raga is shown below:

    [[./images/khamaj_scale_down.png]]
    #+END_rightcol
 
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - The scales are different when ascending and descending, and they have a
    different number of notes, with the ascending scale having 6 notes (called
    shadav) and the descending scale having 7 notes (called sampoorna).
  - Shankar's Raag Khamaj uses a 16 beat rhythm called Teentaal, which is in
    this case performed at a fast tempo.
    
* Miles Davis, Modal Jazz, and /Kind of Blue/
  :PROPERTIES:
  :reveal_background: SteelBlue
  :END:

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Miles Davis was one of the pioneers of the modal jazz movement, and along
    with his colleagues John Coltrane, Bill Evans, and Cannonball Adderley, he
    redefined what jazz music sounded like.
  - In /Kind of Blue/, Davis and his extremely talented band rejected
    traditional chord progressions in favor of modal scales, and they put a
    heavy emphasis on improvisation and spontaneity.
  - Modal jazz, like most other forms of jazz, originated with the blues, and a
    lot of traditional blues elements can be found in modal jazz, such as the
    strophic "Head/Solo/Head" structure. In this structure, the music begins
    with a "head" that serves as the main chorus, followed by a usually lengthy
    improvisation section, and finally a return to the head.
* /So What/
  :PROPERTIES:
  :reveal_background: SteelBlue
  :END:

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - /So What/ is known for having the melody in the bass line, which was very
    unusual then and still unusual today.

  #+END_leftcol_40
  
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
  #+BEGIN_rightcol_60
  - The head is followed by improvisation by each melodic instrument, including
    the alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, trumpet, piano, and bass.
  #+END_rightcol_60

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - The piece is quite simple harmonically, and the piece uses an AABA
    structure. The only harmonic shift is the switch from the D dorian mode to
    the E flat dorian mode in the B section.
  - The simplicity of /So What/ and other modal jazz pieces was intentional, as Miles
    Davis wanted to give musicians freedom to improvise without being
    constrained by a strict chord progression.
* Musical Links
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - Despite the great difference in cultures and location between these two
    musical styles, they share many similarities.
    1. Both pieces diverge from traditional western chord progressions in the
       harmonies and tonality, with /Raag Khamaj/ using the raga and /So What/
       using modes.
    2. Both pieces have a similar structure, with an opening melody followed by
       improvisation.
    3. Both pieces share similar tonal and melodic constructs, such as quickly
       ascending or descending arpeggios and phrases, use of the chromatic
       scale, and bent notes.

* Harmony and Tonality in /So What/
  :PROPERTIES:
  :reveal_background: SteelBlue 
  :END:

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - /So What/, as mentioned before, has a very uniform harmonic structure, and
    the only modulation is the half-step movement from D dorian to E flat dorian
    in the B section.
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
    - The first solo by Davis (see below) centers around the D minor pentatonic.
    - Davis leaves lots of open spaces in his solo, which are filled by open
      voicings centering around diatonic 4th chords, played by the pianist Bill
      Evans.
    - As the solo progresses, Davis transitions from the minor pentatonic to a
      more linear style focusing on the dorian scale. He often returns back to
      the base note D.
    - In the his second transition to the B section, Davis enters early with a
      high, extended, dissonant A flat. Overall however, Davis tends to stay in
      the dorian mode or pentatonic scale, but he occasionally breaks from the
      scale, such as with the "blues note".

* Harmony and Tonality in /Raag Khamaj/ 
  :PROPERTIES:
  :reveal_background: Coral
  :END:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - Shankar's performance of /Raag Khamaj/ similarly revolves around a single
    scale, which is in this case the /Khamaj/ raga.
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
    - Just like Davis, many of Ravi Shankar's riffs travel up and down the raga,
      but repeatedly end on the same note, which is in this case F natural (the
      second note in the ascending scale).
    - This repeated note is known as the vadi in Hindustani music, and it
      serves as the dominant note of the piece.
    - Also similar to /So What/, /Raag Khamaj/ has a flat note in the descending
      scale known as the komal, which serves the same function as the blues note
      in /So What/. This note is used to add color and mood to the music, and it
      is often played repeatedly to add tension.
    - Similar to how /So What/ only uses 2 chords to encourage more free-form
      improvisation, this composition maintains the same raga throughout. While
      Shankar does switch between the ascending and descending scales, the base
      raga itself never changes.
    - The static nature of the tonality forces the improviser to use the scale
      itself to create music and melody, rather than just following the chord
      changes.
* Structure in /Raag Khamaj/
  :PROPERTIES:
  :reveal_background: Coral
  :END:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - Shankar's Raag Khamaj consists of a short, repeated melody of only 5 pitches
    that is returned to throughout the piece. This is known as the bandish.
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
  #+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
  [[./images/bandish.png]]
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - The bandish is followed by improvisation by Ravi Shankar and Anoushka
    Shankar, who generally play separately but occasionally play
    together in polyphony or exchange lines in call and response.
  - The improvisers generally return to the bandish after their improvisation,
    usually following a crescendo.
  - There is an accelerando at the end of the piece, which is followed by a
    cathartic conclusion consisting of repeating sequences of ascending notes and
    ending on tonic (C sharp).
* Structure in /So What/
  :PROPERTIES:
  :reveal_background: SteelBlue
  :END:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in) 
  - /So What/'s structure is very similar to /Raag Khamaj/, as it consists of a
    simple melody called the "head," followed by extended improvisation. The
    chord structure is AABA.
  - Also similiar to /Raag Khamaj/, multiple improvisers take turns soloing.
  - While the main instruments never play together, some polyphony is achieved
    through the interaction between the improviser, piano, and dynamic bass
    line.
  - /So What/ also features a return to the head after the improvisation
    section, which ends in a decrescendo with all of the instruments eventually
    dropping out.
  - Another similarity with Hindustani music is the call and response structure
    used in the head, with the piano and the horns "answering" the melody played
    by the bass. This format was originally influenced by traditional African
    American slave music, and remarkably, it is also similiar to the call and
    response exchange between the 2 sitar players in /Raag Khamaj/.
* Melody and Tone in /So What/
  :PROPERTIES:
  :reveal_background: SteelBlue
  :END:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - The improvisers in /So What/, especially Davis and Coltrane, have very
    similiar styles to Hindustani music.
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
    - Coltrane especially uses many of the same techniques, such as using
      rhythmic sequences in his licks, beginning with slower phrases, then
      transitioning to very quick phrases ascending and descending the chromatic
      scale, as seen below.
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
    #+ATTR_HTML: :width 75%
     [[./images/chromatic.png]]
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
    - Additionally, both Davis and Coltrane have very high ranges, with Davis
      traversing it using piercing, disjunct notes, and Coltrane using flowing
      runs.
    - All of the improvisers also hit many melodic peaks throughout their solos,
      especially "Cannonball" Adderley, who often ends his sequences with two or three
      eighth notes of the same pitch played in swing.
    - Coltrane and Adderley frequently use rapid trills and other
      fast and technical ornamentation in their melodies.
    - Finally, both saxophonists also make use of techniques such as vibrato,
      "growling," and bending notes, which is meant to emulate the human voice
      in traditional African American singing.
* Melody and Tone in /Raag Khamaj/
  :PROPERTIES:
  :reveal_background: Coral
  :END:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - Surprisingly, /Raag Khamaj/ and Hindustani music in general shares many of
    the same melodic constructs as Jazz.
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
    - Just like Coltrane in /So What/, Ravi Shankar frequently ascends up and
      then down the chromatic scale. However, his playing also shares
      similarities to Davis, in that he sometimes moves up or down the raga
      disjunctly using arpeggios, seen below.
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
    #+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
    [[./images/arpeg.png]]
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
    - Many of the melodic peaks in /Raag Khamaj/ are formed by repeating a
      single note over and over again in a crescendo, which usually ends with a
      transition back to the bandish.
    - Ravi Shankar also frequently uses bent notes in his music, which is known
      as meend. This technique also originated from vocal singing, and it is
      very similiar to how Coltrane and Adderley bend their notes.
    - Finally, just like in Jazz music, Ravi Shankar frequently uses syncopation in
      his melodies, which is again demonstrated above.
* Conclusion
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - In conclusion, Hindustani Classical Music and Modal Jazz share many
    similarities that are quite surprising considering that the two cultures are
    completely separate geographically.
  - This investigation helped me connect the music of my Indian heritage to the
    jazz music that I love to listen to and play on the saxophone and piano.
